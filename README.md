# color-line-following
This code is for an adruino uno based 4 wheel/4 motor robot with a Adafruit TCS34725 color sensor and
two photoresisters mounted on the underside. Also an RGB LED is mounted on the top to show the line color being sensed.
In this case a robot kit from elegoo.com was the base to which the additional parts were added.
The software base was the elegoo simple line following example and the Adafruit TCS34725 example code.
